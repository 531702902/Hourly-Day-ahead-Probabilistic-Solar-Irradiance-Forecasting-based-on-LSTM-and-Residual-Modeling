# Hourly-Day-ahead-Probabilistic-Solar-Irradiance-Forecasting-based-on-LSTM-and-Residual-Modeling
This project is mainly for others to reproduce the thesis work.
wx_LSTM_shizhe.py used as a cross test.
wx_LSTM_train.py and wx_LSTM_test.py are used to build LSTM residuals.
wx_PI.py is used to construct Laplacian and Gaussian prediction intervals with different confidence levels.

pre-data.rar contains the data downloaded from the midcdmz.nrel.gov/. Meanwhile,pre-data.rar has been normalized to [-1.1].
